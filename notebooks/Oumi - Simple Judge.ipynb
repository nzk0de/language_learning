        "\n",
        "As LLMs continue to evolve, traditional evaluation benchmarks, which focus primarily on task-specific metrics, are increasingly inadequate for capturing the full scope of a model's generative potential. In real-world applications, LLM capabilities such as creativity, coherence, and the ability to effectively handle nuanced and open-ended queries are critical and cannot be fully assessed through standardized metrics alone. While human raters are often employed to evaluate these aspects, the process is costly and time-consuming. As a result, the use of LLM-based evaluation systems, or \"LLM judges\", has gained traction as a more scalable and efficient alternative."
